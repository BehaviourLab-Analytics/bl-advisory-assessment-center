# Behaviour Lab Advisory Assessment

Thank you for your interest in Behaviour Lab and congratulations on making it to our assessment!!

The aim of today is to test your capabilities of the following:

- Problem solving
- Logical Thinking
- Python
- Communication

The purpose of this assessment is not to examine your financial knowledge, as we are primarily looking for the above skills.

In this directory you will find an excel file called `DataSetAssessmentCentreBL.xlxs` in the data directory. This file will contain two different sheets:

- _1st sheet_: exchange rates of the following currencies to USD: Chinese Yuan (CNY), New Taiwan Dollar (TWD), South Korean Won (KRW), South African Rand (ZAR), Indian Rupee (INR), Hong Kong Dollar (HKD), Brazilian Real (BRL), Malaysian Ringgit (MYR).

- _2nd sheet_: prices of 21 different stocks with prices expressed in the local currency from 18/09/2014 to 10/01/2020 and the Emerging Market Index. Additionally, you will also find the portfolio weight , sector, country and currency related to each stock.

The question we are looking you to solve for is; to identify what you see as the top 3 investments decisions on the fund.

This assessment will take 1 hour and a half; during which you will be expected to use Python to solve for the problem. Talk us through your thinking and explain your thought process as much as possible

We will be looking for you to present on the following:

- Your definition of the problem
- Assumptions made
- Your conclusions
- What you found most challenging
- If there is anything further you would have liked to do, if you had more time

Best of luck,
Behaviour Lab Team
